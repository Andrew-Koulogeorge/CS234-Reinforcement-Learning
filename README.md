# CS 234: Reinforcement Learning Winter 2023
My solutions for the problem sets for [CS 234 at Stanford taught in Winter 2023]([url](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs234/)) by Emma Brunskill. I self studied this material during Winter 2024 while an undergraduate student at Dartmouth College. For self-study materials, I used [Stanford's free YouTube RL lecture videos from 2019]([url](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgzM3zpZ55o)) and the [Sutton and Barto]([url](http://incompleteideas.net/book/the-book-2nd.html)) textbook on RL (free online as well as).

Each directory contains code and theoretical solutions to the problem sets. If you have any questions regarding my solutions, please feel free to reach out to me at andrew.j.koulogeorge.24@dartmouth.edu
